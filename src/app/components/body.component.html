        Hello Pals! This a SPA Serverless in Angular 18, where I applied a lot
        of technologies. Beyond Angular 18 I used, Firebase Database, Firebase Auth, Css and BootStrap css
        and Github Deploy.

      <p>
        If you have curiosity about this SPA and the technologies developed that
        on my own hit at <a [routerLink]="'/about'">" About. "</a>

        I'm going to share my personal opinion. Sorry, but I don’t believe in the idea of a "full-stack professional"
        who knows everything? No one can know it all, not even AI! I believe in specialists who are experts in specific
        technologies, working together on the backend and frontend.

        Speaking of AI, it's a great tool that relies on information from specialists, accessing their repositories. If
        specialists stop pushing new code versions to these repositories, AI will eventually become outdated.
